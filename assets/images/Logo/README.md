# MOO Logo Assets

This folder contains the official logo assets for **Marketing Options Online**.

## Files
*   `logo-full.png`: The complete logo with text, suited for website headers and standard branding.
*   `logo-icon.png`: The mark-only version, perfect for social media profile pictures, favicons, or secondary branding.

## Scalability and Quality
These files are provided in high-resolution PNG format. 

### Why PNG?
PNG is excellent for web use because it supports transparency (allowing the logo to sit cleanly on any background) and high detail.

### Scalability (SVG)
The user asked: *"What logo files are you able to create so that I could scale the logo up and down without it pixelating?"*

The technical answer is **SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)**. 
- **PNG/JPG**: These are "raster" formats (made of pixels). If you stretch them, they become blurry/pixelated.
- **SVG**: These are "vector" formats (made of mathematical paths). You can scale an SVG to the size of a skyscraper or down to the size of a postage stamp, and it will remain pin-sharp.

### Refinement (Jan 13, 2026)
Based on your feedback, I have:
1.  **Increased the logo size**: The header logo is now 60px high, and the footer logo is 70px high for better readability.
2.  **Color-matched backgrounds**: Created `logo-header.png` (white background) and `logo-footer.png` (navy background matching `#0D1B2A`) to blend seamlessly with the site.
3.  **Dedicated assets**:
    *   `logo-header.png`: Optimized for the white header background.
    *   `logo-footer.png`: Optimized for the dark navy footer background.

## How to Achieve True Transparency (Free Tools)
Since AI-generated images often have solid backgrounds, you can use these free, high-quality tools to remove the background and create a true transparent PNG:

### 1. Photopea (Best Overall)
*   **Website**: [photopea.com](https://www.photopea.com)
*   **Method**: 
    1.  Open `logo-header.png` in Photopea.
    2.  Select the **Magic Wand** tool (W).
    3.  Click on the white background.
    4.  Press `Delete`.
    5.  Go to `File > Export As > PNG` to save your transparent version.

### 2. Remove.bg (Fastest)
*   **Website**: [remove.bg](https://www.remove.bg)
*   **Method**: Just upload the file, and it will automatically remove the background. Use this for quick results, though it may slightly compress the image.

### 3. GIMP (Desktop App)
*   **Website**: [gimp.org](https://www.gimp.org)
*   **Method**: A powerful, free alternative to Photoshop. Use the "Fuzzy Select Tool" and "Add Alpha Channel" to remove backgrounds.

## SVG Recommendations
For the absolute best quality and infinite scalability (perfect for printing or billboards), I highly recommend having a designer trace this logo into an **SVG** file. This will naturally have a transparent background and will never look blurry, regardless of size.

**Recommendation**: Use these PNGs for the website and most office documents (Word, PowerPoint). For professional high-resolution printing (banners, vehicle wraps), you should provide a vector (SVG or AI) file to your printer.
